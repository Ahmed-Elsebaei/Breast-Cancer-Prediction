# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
In this project, I trained 4 models and cross-validated their best parameters to predict whether the tumor is benign or malignant
Used Standard Scaler to scale my features.
Used RandomizedSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters.
Obtained models with very promising accuracy and precision values
Applied EDA using Microsoft Power BI on this link https://www.novypro.com/project/breast-cancer
